"""Floating point differences --- dulp

dulp measures directed differences between floating point numbers by
counting the discrete spaces between them.

This distance was proposed by an anonymous reviewer to
*"On the definition of ulp(x)"* (JM Muller 2005).

>>> from dulp import dulp
>>>
>>> dulp(1., 1. + 2.**-52) # 1.
>>> dulp((1. + 5**0.5)/2, 1.6180339887) # -224707.
>>> dulp(-0., 0.) # 1.


Each float gets an integer valuation val(x) which satisfies

>>> val(0.) == 0 # True

>>> val(x + eps) == val(x) + 1 # True

where x + eps is the next floating point number after x.

Floats almost have this naturally when reinterpreted as integers,
but are reversed for negative numbers.
We just reverse negative numbers' order.


The dulp(x, y) directed distance from x to y equals val(y) - val(x),
casted to float for convenience with small and large distances.


A bits-precision equivalent conversion is given by dulpbits.


Assumes IEEE 764 binary64 for floats.
